            The world of web development is moving faster than ever—and 2025 is
            shaping up to be a breakthrough year. As digital experiences become
            more immersive, efficient, and intelligent, staying ahead of these
            trends will be crucial for businesses aiming to stay competitive.

            At <strong>Lazy Do</strong>, we constantly experiment,
            prototype, and deliver solutions aligned with what’s next. Here's a
            look at the top web development trends that are poised to reshape
            the internet.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            🔮 1. Serverless Architecture Will Dominate
          </h2>
          <p>
            With platforms like AWS Lambda, Netlify, and Vercel, serverless
            functions enable developers to run backend logic without managing
            infrastructure—leading to lower costs, auto-scaling, and faster
            deployments.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            ⚡ 2. Edge Computing Enhances Speed
          </h2>
          <p>
            By processing data closer to the user’s location, edge computing
            dramatically reduces latency. Expect more websites using CDN-based
            logic for real-time performance boosts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            🧠 3. AI-Powered Interfaces & Copilots
          </h2>
          <p>
            From chatbots to content generators and smart dashboards, AI will
            continue to elevate user experience with personalization, intent
            prediction, and natural language capabilities.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            🎨 4. Motion UI & 3D Interactions
          </h2>
          <p>
            Subtle animations, interactive transitions, and WebGL-based 3D
            experiences are becoming the new normal—especially in portfolios,
            SaaS products, and digital commerce.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            🧩 5. Component-First & Design Systems
          </h2>
          <p>
            Frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte are increasingly being used
            alongside design systems (e.g., Tailwind, ShadCN, Radix) for UI
            consistency, scalability, and accessibility.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            🔐 6. Privacy by Design
          </h2>
          <p>
            With growing concerns around data privacy, web apps are now
            expected to embed consent management, encryption, and compliance
            (GDPR, CCPA) by default.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
            🚀 What This Means for Your Business
          </h2>
          <p>
            Web development is no longer just about websites—it’s about digital
            experiences that perform, evolve, and empower. Companies investing
            in these trends early will deliver faster, smarter, and more secure
            platforms.
