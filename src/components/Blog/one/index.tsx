          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">üß† Real-World Example</h2>
          <p>
            One of our enterprise clients needed a logistics tracking platform
            that worked across multiple countries, with region-specific tax
            calculations, user roles, and third-party integrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We designed a scalable architecture using microservices, enabled
            role-based access control, and delivered a dashboard that
            auto-adapts to regional data laws. The result? <strong>35%</strong>{" "}
            operational efficiency improvement within six months.
